Question #0

To store the address of this function:

void neyo(void);

to the variable f of type pointer to a function that does not take any argument and does not return anything, you would do (check all correct answers if there is more than one):

    f = &neyo;

    f = neyo;

    *f = &neyo;

    *f = neyo;

Question #1

If f is a pointer to a function that takes no parameter and returns an int, you can call the function pointed by f this way (check all correct answers if there is more than one):

    (*f)();

    f();

    f;

Question #2

What does a pointer to a function point to (check all correct answers if there is more than one)?

    code

    data

    The first byte of code of the function

    The first character of the name of the function

Question #3

Which one is a pointer to a function?

    int *func(int a, float b);

    int func(int a, float b);

    (int *)func(int a, float b);

    int (*func)(int a, float b);

Question #4

This void (*anjula[])(int, float) is:

    A pointer to a function that takes an array of int and float as a parameter and returns nothing

    An array of pointers to functions that take an int and a float as parameters and returns nothing

    A pointer to a function that takes an int and a float as parameters and returns nothing

    A pointer to an array of functions that take an int and a float as parameters and returns nothing

    A pointer to a function that takes an int and a float as parameters and returns an empty array
